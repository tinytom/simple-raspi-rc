# simple-raspi-rc
This is simple script written for remote control of raspberry pi's GPIO over UDP (within local subnet, eg. wifi)
It's intent is to control the raspberrypi motors over gpio but it can be easily forged to do anything else.

## Installation
- You will need python3.5+ on both your computer and rPi.
- The only dependency you need is `keyboard`
